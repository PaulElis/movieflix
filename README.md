## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

[Git](https://git-scm.com/) (git --version, preinstalled on MacOS)

[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/):

• See “engines” from package.json for supported versions

• Use node --version && npm --version to check your current version.

• I recommend managing Node.js versions using [NVM](https://github.com/creationix/nvm).

### Run `npm install`

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
